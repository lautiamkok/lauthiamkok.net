Many of them were fearless, enjoying my company; some were shy and watchful. Just like dogs, cats, and humans, each of them is an individual with a distinct personality. I liked them coming in the kitchen scouring for food, walking around in the house. They always seemed to be talking to me with their perculiar language, so I talked to them with their language, then they startled and looking at each others and started talking to themselves, seemed to be laughing at me. They never forgot the corners where they laid their eggs. I watched the eggs hatched. I watched them grew up, aged and died. I made sure no human or other bigger animals would kill them for food. I taught them to sleep on the tree at nights. Then they taught each other and their generations to hop through branches to the top of the trees in every evening when the sun went down. Sometimes I woke up at night worrying about them when it rained and the wind howled. Now they all are gone just like many other things in my oldest home and memory. I only can think of them. Think of them fondly - the beautiful creatures that once climbed trees and slept on branches like owls...\n\n20.10.2012, 05:12 pm, Wednesday.\n",

Home, is not here, nor is there, nor used to be. Earth is not home. Countries are not home. I have been misled by my dreams and of my mother, and by the stories she told, and by the books I have read. England or the United Kingdom is not my home, nor is Malaysia, nor is China, nor is Africa. Home is not geographical, nor is it political. It is ontological. It is the urge to be at home everywhere. Home, it is wherever we want to go to, but is where we can find a place to stay – for a while. We set up 'home' in impermanent places such as Earth. We all perhaps are aliens, once or twice or maybe more, flourished and reincarnated over many other planets that in the end were torched by their dying stars. Together we were vaporised and blasted into atoms, carried by cosmic winds, trapped inside comets, and then descended on Earth, in which we evolved once more and misconceived this rock as home, and misguided by our histories, our emotions, our languages, our ancient tales, anthems and songs, that we never forget, that we are taught to guard and fortify our mountains and pastures with bows, arrows, spears, and chariots, to keep away the lowly and satanic countenance from our green and pleasant land. We are mere star stuff, caught with each others in the net of life and time, fellow prisoners of the splendour and travail of the Earth. We all are humble migrants that once were atoms forged in the blistering furnaces deep inside stars, blown across unimaginable gulfs of space and time by the wind between the stars. One day, when Earth dies, we will migrate to another planet; when our galaxy dies, we will migrate to another galaxy; when our universe dies, we will migrate to another universe. When we look back in the future one day, we will realise this: we all are travelers and creatures of distance. Journey is home. Exploration is home. Working is home. Migration is home. Road, is home - where we keep running to, where in every trip, our memory returns to the point of origin which we promise our parents, our children, our love ones and friends, that we will come back to each others.\n\n21.03.2013, 04:50 pm, Thursday.\n",

      "contents": "Maybe I was a cat in my past life, that's why I am always related to cats in this life. I love animals: cats, dogs, chickens, ducks, elephants, tigers, lions... but I simply love cats. I love touching their silky smooth fur; I love to hear them purr when I stroke them; I love looking at their sparkling big round eyes; their wiry tails, their long thin whiskers, and their pointy ears. I just love them, as long as they are cats, regardless of its breeds; no matter what colours their are, I just want to hold them.\n\nMaybe I was a cat, as friends tell me that I resemble a cat, and some even say that my eyes are like cat's. I am not scared to be like a cat, to be able to do as I like, with lots of freedom too. They are dirty yet don't mind being laughed at; they are lazy yet they don't care. They will curl up their body and sleep in the corner, enjoying the moment. Time can't make them go fast, slow or be lazy, they move at their own pace. If they see a prey, they will creep up and pounce on it. But if they see their enemy, they will run away. If they meet the people they don't like, they will avoid them.\n\nMaybe, I really resemble a cat. Ever since I was growing up, cats loves to come close to me (because I am like them?). When they are hungry, they will meow at me; when they want some attention, they will come around my ankle and rub themselves against my legs; when they want to take a nap, they will jump into my arms cradle; when they want to sleep at night, they will cross the roof into my room. Then, they will lie down on my bed, give a few purrs and fall asleep.\n\nFrom my memory, I had a lot of cats, a white cat, a black cat, a yellow cat, a black and brown cat, a spotted cat, a tiger stripped cat ... but when they appear, they appear at different times. When the white left, the black came; when the black disappeared, the yellow appeared. They left, they never came back. They may have been captured; they may have gone back to the wilderness; they may have found a new master. They never tell me, and never hint to me. The elderly tell me that when a cat leaves, it will never come back. But I don't believe that, and await for their return every night, but I will believe this until the next cat appears.\n\nNow, I don't have a cat anymore, I am afraid of the loneliness when they leave; the quietness when they leave; and the boredom that haunts me when they leave. Maybe it's because of me that they are missing, captured or killed. Because of their beauty; because I have spoiled them.\n\nEven though I don't have cat anymore, cats still appear before my eyes, cats from the streets, other people's cats, they just love to come to me. They love to tease me, meowing away. They love to sleep in my cradling arms.\n\nMaybe I was really a cat, and at that time, they had already known me. And wait for me in this lifetime. When I am lonely, they know, they will appear by my side respectively, and when the time comes, they'll disappear again, respectively.\n\n(1998)\n",

When I was small, you used to tell me a story, in which at the beginning of my life you found me by the tip abandoned and unwanted. I still believe that joke today. So must you remembered that many times I begged you to take me to where you found me. One day you did take me to the tip. I stood at the giant bin tank and goggle. You giggled and had fun. I was a little unwanted soul - a little joy of yours. I still remember the rusty smell of the bin tank with the waste people dumped there. Sometimes they dumped babies, live kittens... they all died unwanted. 'But I saved you and took you home', you always said. So towards the end of your life, you must have thought of me as the cat that you fed each day. When you saw the cat, you saw me. When you talked to the cat, you talked to me. When you held the cat, you held me... until the end of your time. You are now free from time. I am still a time's prisoner. At times, when I see a cat, I see you. When I talk to cats, I talk to you. When I hold a cat, I hold you. When cats look at me, it seems that it is you who is looking at me. You must have lived in cats since. When I feed the unwanted cat from the neighbourhood, I learn how you and your cat lived - both of you just wanted to be wanted. Perhaps, it was one day in the sunny afternoon, you were alone by yourself at home, looking into the distance where you could see the span of sea from the hill, wondering where all your children and grandchildren were, thinking of me, then the unwanted cat wandered into your sight, wanted to be wanted just as much as you did. So, you found the cat and the cat found you. Just like you found me by the tip and I found you under the Sun. We have no differences - you, me, or cats. All life were made by stars. Tangled on Earth. Mysterious souls. Sometimes I am a cat. Sometimes I am you. Sometimes I am the unwanted from the tip. You found me. I found you. From time to time, we still find each others.\n\n20.02.2013, 02:08 am, Wednesday.\n",

We only can think of it, in the line of an abstract time that is deprived of all thickness.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I only read and re-read what I like, with a bit of reader&#39;s pride mixed in with much enthusiasm. But whereas pride usually develop into a massive sentiment that weighs upon the entire psyche, the touch of pride that is born of adherence to the felicity of an image, remains secret and unobtrusive. It is with within us, mere readers that we are, it is for us, and for us alone. It is a homely sort of pride. Nobody knows that in reading we are re-living our temptations to be poet. All readers who have a certain passion for reading, nurture and repress, though reading, the desire to become a writer. When the page we have just read is too near perfection, our modesty suppresses this desire. But it reappears, nevertheless. In any case, every reader who re-reads a work that he likes, knows that its pages concern him.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Gaston Bachelard (1958), <a href=\"/local/0735227934?linkCode=gs2&amp;tag=braipick-21\" title=\"The best search engine for privacy\">The Poetics of Space</a></p>\n",

In these spaces, we feel time's elasticity as acutely as one who, alone in the house in the late evening, awaits the return of his beloved, in a state in which all other spiritual activity has ceased. He is, as the Chinese say, 'looking at the door', trusting that soon the key will grate in the lock, the handle turn, an the waiting, which can now be forgotten, be at an end. The power that radiates from this moment illuminates for a time the whole perceptual world. It recompenses the the one who waited with the news that the waiting wasn't in vain, and it exercises its own untriumphal victory over the other emotions. A world glistening with joy is a world that can easily do without fear, without anger, disgust and jealousy, and a world that can do without these is a world worth living in.\n\nStuart Walton, [Humanity: An Emotional History](https://amzn.to/314dlNp \"Humanity: An Emotional History\"), 2004. {.line-before}\n"

He points out as evidence for his\nclaim the pleasure we take in looking at things and assimilating information\nthrough our senses. Sensation is of course shared with many other animals,\nand the accretion of sensation through memory into experience is shared\nwith some. But humans are unique in their capacity to derive universal\njudgements from their experiences. Animals act by instinct or acquired\nhabit, but humans are capable of acting from understanding: they know (as\na dog might know) *that* this is the thing to do in a certain situation, but they\nmay also understand (as a dog cannot) *why* it is the thing to do. This is what\nAristotle calls in Greek *tekhnê*; the word is conventionally translated as\n‘craft’, ‘skill’ or ‘art’, but Aristotle defines *tekhnê* as a productive capacity\ninformed by an understanding of its intrinsic rationale (cf. *Nicomachean\nEthics*, 1140a20f,). For Aristotle, the evolution of human culture is in large\npart the evolution of *tekhnê*. The first arts which human beings developed\nwere those concerned with producing the necessities of their existence.\nThen came recreational arts - those which, while not necessary, enhance the\nquality of human life. In due course, activities arose which simply satisfy\nthe desire to know (Aristotle’s example is mathematics). Ultimately,\nphilosophy emerged. Philosophy is rooted in the basic human instinct to\nseek knowledge: the world puzzles us and arouses our sense of wonder, and\nso prompts us to look for explanations. Philosophy is therefore the\nsophisticated descendant of primitive myth-making responses to an\nastonishing world.\n\nMalcolm Heath, [Poetics  (Penguin Classics)](https://amzn.to/31cX0WH \"Poetics  (Penguin Classics)\"), 1996. {.line-before}\n"

We’re way beyond the\n  point where this might all be another polywater or N-ray-type situation that\n  everybody’s going to be embarrassed about in a few years’ time. And yet\n  apparently there are still plenty of people who have enough reasons to deny\n  it—financial, political, the sheer bloody-minded joy of being a contrarian\n  knobber—that we keep getting dragged back to the “debate about whether\n  it’s real” stage every time it looks like we might make some progress on the\n  “actually do something about it” stage. It’s pretty much the playbook the\n  manufacturers of leaded gasoline used back in the day: you don’t need to\n  disprove something, you just need to be able to claim the jury’s out long\n  enough to keep raking in that sweet, sweet profit.\n\n> In some ways, it feels like it would be a weirdly poetic end to the journey\n  that Lucy failed to begin all those millions of years ago. All that\n  exploration, all that progress, all those dreams and grand notions, and that’s\n  where we end up: trapped on our planet by a prison we’ve made from our\n  own trash.\n\n> Whatever our future holds, whatever baffling changes come along in the\n  next year, the next decade and the next century, it seems likely that we’ll\n  keep on doing basically the same things. We will blame other people for our\n  woes, and construct elaborate fantasy worlds so that we don’t have to think\n  about our sins. We will turn to populist leaders in the aftermath of economic\n  crises. We will scramble for money. We will succumb to groupthink and\n  manias and confirmation bias. We will tell ourselves that our plans are very\n  good plans and that nothing can possibly go wrong.\n\n> Or...maybe we won’t? Maybe this is the moment that we change, and\n  start learning from our history. Maybe all this is just being pessimistic, and\n  no matter how dumb and depressing the world today may sometimes seem,\n  in actuality humanity is getting wiser and more enlightened, and we are\n  lucky enough to live at the dawn of a new age of not fucking up. Maybe we\n  really do have the capacity to be better.\n\nTom Phillips, [Humans](https://amzn.to/2DztVNm \"Humans: A Brief History of How We F*cked It All Up\"), 2018. {.line-before}\n"

He does not reserve a special look for man. But by no other species except man will the animal’s look be recognised as familiar. Other animals are held by the look. Man becomes aware of himself returning the look.\n\n> Everywhere animals disappear. In zoos they constitute the living monument to their own disappearance. And in doing so, they provoked their last metaphor.\n\n> All sites of enforced marginalisation — ghettos, shanty towns, prisons, madhouses, concentration camps — have something in common with zoos. But it is both too easy and too evasive to use the zoo as a symbol. The zoo is a demonstration of the relations between man and animals; nothing else.\n\nJohn Berger, [Why Look at Animals?](https://amzn.to/3frSRE7 \"Why Look at Animals?\") 2009. {.line-before}\n"

From planets to stars, solar systems to galaxies, black holes to\nswirling nebulae, nothing is everlasting. Indeed, as far as we can tell, not only\nis each individual life finite, but so too is life itself. Planet earth, which Carl Sagan described as a “mote of dust suspended on a sunbeam,” is an evanescent bloom in an exquisite cosmos that will ultimately be barren. Motes\nof dust, nearby or distant, dance on sunbeams for merely a moment.\n\n> Still, here on earth we have punctuated our moment with astonishing feats\nof insight, creativity, and ingenuity as each generation has built on the\nachievements of those who have gone before, seeking clarity on how it all\ncame to be, pursuing coherence in where it is all going, and longing for an\nanswer to why it all matters.\n\n> As we hurtle toward a cold and barren cosmos, we must accept that there\nis no grand design. Particles are not endowed with purpose. There is no final\nanswer hovering in the depths of space awaiting discovery. Instead, certain\nspecial collections of particles can think and feel and reflect, and within these\nsubjective worlds they can create purpose. And so, in our quest to fathom the\nhuman condition, the only direction to look is inward. That is the noble\ndirection to look. It is a direction that forgoes ready-made answers and turns\nto the highly personal journey of constructing our own meaning. It is a\ndirection that leads to the very heart of creative expression and the source of\nour most resonant narratives. Science is a powerful, exquisite tool for grasping\nan external reality. But within that rubric, within that understanding,\neverything else is the human species contemplating itself, grasping what it\nneeds to carry on, and telling a story that reverberates into the darkness, a\nstory carved of sound and etched into silence, a story that, at its best, stirs the\nsoul.\n\nBrian Greene, [Until the End of Time](https://amzn.to/3idTQbU \"Until the End of Time: Mind, Matter, and Our Search for Meaning in an Evolving Universe\"), 2020. {.line-before}\n"

In a cosmic perspective, most human concerns seem insignificant, even petty. And yet our species is young and curious and brave and shows much promise. In the last few millennia we have made the most astonishing and unexpected discoveries about the Cosmos and our place within it, explorations that are exhilarating to consider. They remind us that humans have evolved to wonder, that understanding is a joy, that knowledge is prerequisite to survival. I believe our future depends on how well we know this Cosmos in which we float like a mote of dust in the morning sky.\n\n> Those explorations required skepticism and imagination both. Imagination will often carry us to worlds that never were. But without it, we go nowhere. Skepticism enables us to distinguish fancy from fact, to test our speculations. The Cosmos is rich beyond measure - in elegant facts, in exquisite interrelationships, in the subtle machinery of awe.\n\n> As long as there have been humans, we have searched for our place in the Cosmos. In the childhood of our species (when our ancestors gazed a little idly at the stars), among the Ionian scientists of ancient Greece, and in our own age, we have been transfixed by this question: Where are we? Who are we? We find that we live on an insignificant planet of a humdrum star lost between two spiral arms in the outskirts of a galaxy which is a member of a sparse cluster of galaxies, tucked away in some forgotten corner of a universe in which there are far more galaxies than people. This perspective is a courageous continuation of our penchant for constructing and testing mental models of the skies; the Sun as a red-hot stone, the stars as celestial flame, the Galaxy as the backbone of night.\n\n> We embarked on our cosmic voyage with a question first framed in the childhood of our species and in each generation asked anew with undiminished wonder: What are the stars? Exploration is in our nature. We began as wanderers, and we are wanderers still. We have lingered long enough on the shores of the cosmic ocean. We are ready at last to set sail for the stars.\n\n> For we are the local embodiment of a Cosmos grown to self-\nawareness. We have begun to contemplate our origins: starstuff\npondering the stars; organized assemblages of ten billion billion\nbillion atoms considering the evolution of atoms; tracing the long\njourney by which, here at least, consciousness arose. Our loyal­\nties are to the species and the planet. We speak for Earth. Our\nobligation to survive is owed not just to ourselves but also to that\nCosmos, ancient and vast, from which we spring.\n\nCarl Sagan, [Cosmos](https://amzn.to/3fg2RiR \"Cosmos\"), 1980. {.line-before}\n"

It's an arrangement so specialized and particular that it has never\nbeen tried before and will only exist this once.\n\n> Why atoms take this trouble is a bit of a puzzle. Being you is not a\ngratifying experience at the atomic level. For all their devoted attention,\nyour atoms don't actually care about you—indeed, don't even know that you\nare there. They don't even know that they are there. They are mindless\nparticles, after all, and not even themselves alive.\n\n> [...] And when that modest milestone flashes past, or at some\nother point thereabouts, for reasons unknown your atoms will shut you\ndown, silently disassemble, and go off to be other things. And that's it for\nyou.\n\n> Still, you may rejoice that it happens at all. Generally speaking in the\nuniverse it doesn't, so far as we can tell. This is decidedly odd because the\natoms that so liberally and congenially flock together to form living things\non Earth are exactly the same atoms that decline to do it elsewhere.\nWhatever else it may be, at the level of chemistry life is curiously mundane:\ncarbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen, a little calcium, a dash of sulfur, a\nlight dusting of other very ordinary elements—nothing you wouldn't find in\nany ordinary drugstore—and that's all you need. The only thing special\nabout the atoms that make you is that they make you. That is of course the\nmiracle of life.\n\n> So thank goodness for atoms. But the fact that you have atoms and that\nthey assemble in such a willing manner is only part of what got you here.\nTo be here now, alive in the twenty-first century and smart enough to know\nit, you also had to be the beneficiary of an extraordinary string of biological\ngood fortune [...] Life on Earth,\nyou see, is not only brief but dismayingly tenuous. It is a curious feature of\nour existence that we come from a planet that is very good at promoting life\nbut even better at extinguishing it.\n\n> If this book has a lesson, it is that we are awfully lucky to be here—and\nby “we” I mean every living thing. To attain any kind of life in this universe\nof ours appears to be quite an achievement. As humans we are doubly\nlucky, of course: We enjoy not only the privilege of existence but also the\nsingular ability to appreciate it and even, in a multitude of ways, to make it\nbetter. It is a talent we have only barely begun to grasp.\n\n> We have arrived at this position of eminence in a stunningly short time.\nBehaviorally modern human beings—that is, people who can speak and\nmake art and organize complex activities—have existed for only about\n0.0001 percent of Earth's history. But surviving for even that little while has\nrequired a nearly endless string of good fortune.\n\n> We really are at the beginning of it all. The trick, of course, is to make\nsure we never find the end. And that, almost certainly, will require a good\ndeal more than lucky breaks.\n\nBill Bryson, [A Short History of Nearly Everything](https://amzn.to/3gxzKsS \"A Short History of Nearly Everything\"), 2003. {.line-before}\n"

If we do\nnot destroy mankind, these few thousand years may be only a tiny fraction\nof the whole of civilized human history. The difference between\n[possibilities] 2 and 3 may thus be the difference between this tiny fraction\nand all of the rest of history.”\n\n> Extinction, as the environmental slogan goes, is forever.19 The true\nhorror of the end of the world is measured not by our own deaths, and the\ndeaths of everyone we know and love, not just by the deaths of our children\nand grandchildren, but by the nullification of all who would come after\nthem, all those who would live and love and carry this species forward. An\nexistential risk realized is the death of the future.\n\n> People have changed, of course. We’ve largely abandoned hideous\npractices like slavery, expanded the circle of human rights, and fought for\nthe power to rule ourselves. But those changes mostly fed the engine of\ngrowth, and put more power in the hands of individuals, to be used for good\nor ill. Short of a fundamental political or even spiritual revolution, what I\ncan’t see changing is that primal human drive to expand.\n\n> Perhaps I’m suffering from a failure of imagination. The Marxist\npolitical theorist and literary critic Fredric Jameson, after all, once wrote\nthat it is “easier to imagine the end of the world than to imagine the end of\ncapitalism.” But everywhere I’ve traveled on this planet, I’ve seen people\nwho want more. More for themselves, and more for their children. Who will\ntell them they can’t have it, even if it may cost the world?\n\n> So we must run faster, as if we’re running for our lives.\n\nBryan Walsh, [End Times](https://amzn.to/2XIfiOC \"End Times: A Brief Guide to the End of the World\"), 2019. {.line-before}\n"

Always and again we have been the co-creators of a time and a cosmos that exist together with us. That is what makes our story anything but insignificant and makes our universes anything but meaningless. We have always been weaving the fabric of our experience into a culturally shared time and, in the process, have become ever more intimate with a universe that has always invited our participation. With each step we gain a new perspective, even if it will never be the final perspective. That is just fine. With each step we gain a deeper sense of the awe and beauty that suffuse the universe’s essential mystery. If we can trace our steps from the past and see our way clearly into the future, then certainly there is time enough for that great effort to continue with renewed clarity and purpose.\n\nAdam Frank, [About Time](https://amzn.to/311KNp1 \"About Time\"), 2011. {.line-before}\n",

But whereas pride usually develop into a massive sentiment that weighs upon the entire psyche, the touch of pride that is born of adherence to the felicity of an image, remains secret and unobtrusive. It is with within us, mere readers that we are, it is for us, and for us alone. It is a homely sort of pride. Nobody knows that in reading we are re-living our temptations to be poet. All readers who have a certain passion for reading, nurture and repress, though reading, the desire to become a writer. When the page we have just read is too near perfection, our modesty suppresses this desire. But it reappears, nevertheless. In any case, every reader who re-reads a work that he likes, knows that its pages concern him.\n\nGaston Bachelard, [The Poetics of Space](https://amzn.to/307aen8 \"The best search engine for privacy\"), 1958. {.line-before}\n"

          "contents": "> Our universe is dotted ‘with over 100 billion galaxies, and each one\ncontains roughly 100 billion stars. It is unclear how many planets are\norbiting these stars, but it is certain that at least one of them has evolved\nlife. In particular, there is a life form that has had the capacity and audacity\nto speculate about the origin of this vast universe.\n\n> Humans have been staring up into space for thousands of generations,\nbut we are privileged to be part of the first generation who can claim to\nhave a respectable, rational and coherent description for the creation and\nevolution of the universe. The Big Bang model offers an elegant\nexplanation of the origin of everything we see in the night sky, making it\none of the greatest achievements of the human intellect and spirit. It is the\nconsequence of an insatiable curiosity, a fabulous imagination, acute\nobservation and ruthless logic.\n\n> According to a Chinese creation myth that dates to 600 BC, Phan Ku the\nGiant Creator emerged from an egg and proceeded to create the world by\nusing a chisel to carve valleys and mountains from the landscape. Next, he\nset the Sun, Moon and stars in the sky; he died as soon as these tasks were\nfinished. The death of the Giant Creator was an essential part of the creation\nprocess, because fragments of his own body helped to complete the world.\nPhan Ku’s skull formed the dome of sky, his flesh formed the soil, his bones\nbecame rocks and his blood created rivers and seas. The last of his breath\nforged the wind and clouds, while his sweat became rain. His hair fell to\nEarth, creating plant life, and the fleas that had lodged in his hair provided\nthe basis for the human race. As our birth required the death of our creator,\nwe were to be cursed with sorrow forever after.\n\n> Unfortunately, the scientific community has to admit that all these possible answers, from rebounding universes to spontaneous quantum creation, are highly speculative and do not yet properly address the ultimate question of where the universe came from. Nevertheless, the current generation of cosmologists should not be downhearted. They should rejoice in the fact that the Big Bang model is a coherent and consistent description of our universe. They should be proud that the Big Bang model is a pinnacle of human achievement, because it explains so much of the universe’s present by revealing its past. They should go out and tell the world that the Big Bang model is a tribute to human curiosity and our intellect. And if a member of the public should ask the toughest question of all, ‘What came before the Big Bang?’, then they might consider following St Augustine’s example.\n\n> In his autobiography, Confessions, written in about AD 400, the philosopher and theologian St Augustine quotes an answer he has heard to the theological equivalent of ‘What came before the Big Bang?’: What was God doing before He created the Universe? Before He created Heaven and Earth, God created hell to be used for people such as you who ask this kind of question.\n\nSimon Singh, [Big Bang](https://amzn.to/2BSY3m4 \"Big Bang\"), 2004. {.line-before}\n"
