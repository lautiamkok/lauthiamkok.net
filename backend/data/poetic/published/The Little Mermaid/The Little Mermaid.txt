'Why have not we an immortal soul? The little mermaid had asked mournfully. I would give gladly all the hundreds of years that I have to live, to be a human being only for one day, and to have the hope of knowing the happiness of that glorious world above the stars.'

Perhaps we all are born with an immortal soul and could be genuinely happy for three thousand years on this planet, like the little mermaid at the bottom of the sea; but we are fond of the illusive and transitory happiness on the land above the sea, craving for love like the little mermaid wants from the prince. Therefore, we are cursed with an eternal destiny: the loss of our gift of immortality; plunged into the feeling of cutting by sharp knives on every step; becoming the foam on the surface of the water; and we shall never return to the sea that we should love.
