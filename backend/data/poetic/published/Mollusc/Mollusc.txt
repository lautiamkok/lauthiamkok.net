I like rain, especially the sound of rain. When the rain sounds, it sounds like home. So, even if I am far away from home, in the sound of rain, I am home. I remember my oldest home where snails in the garden, carrying their home in their shells wherever they explored in the rainy days, sleepy morning, and starry nights. I must be resembling molluscs, carrying the notion of home wherever I go. So, I am always at home, even if I seem have not been around, I am not far in your garden when it rains.
