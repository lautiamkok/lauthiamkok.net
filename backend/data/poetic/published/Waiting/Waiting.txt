If you never come
I will wither with the Fall
Go with the Streams
Increase with the Sea
Becoming Seasalt
Be delivered to your food
Everyday.

If you never come
I will age with the Sky
Be buried in the Meadows
Grow with Nature
Becoming a Tree
To protect you forever
Where I have been standing
Decades for You.
