When I was born human,
I think of kindness.

When I was born cat,
I think of cuddles.

When I was born bee,
I think of honey.

When I was born flower,
I think of butterflies.

When I was born star,
I think of planets.

When I was born universe,
I think of infinity.

When I am born dream,
I think of dreamers

who think of me
and I think of them.
