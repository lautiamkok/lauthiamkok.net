We are a piece of a poem
Can be written can be sung
Bridged and unbridgeable
Like the ocean like the sky.

You are a piece of a poem
You are the cloud you are the wind
Touched and untouchable
Reached and unreachable
Like a dream and dreams.

I am a poem
I was the storm
Now I am the river
Melts in the ocean
Looking up at you looking up at you
(Who) sew my words (who) weave my dreams
In the blue land above me.
