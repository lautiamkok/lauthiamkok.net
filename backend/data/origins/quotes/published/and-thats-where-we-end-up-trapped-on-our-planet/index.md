      > That man-made climate change is real, and potentially an existential
        threat to many communities around the world and many aspects of
        civilization, is so well established as a scientific fact by this point that it
        seems kind of dull to run over the evidence again. We’re way beyond the
        point where this might all be another polywater or N-ray-type situation that
        everybody’s going to be embarrassed about in a few years’ time. And yet
        apparently there are still plenty of people who have enough reasons to deny
        it—financial, political, the sheer bloody-minded joy of being a contrarian
        knobber—that we keep getting dragged back to the “debate about whether
        it’s real” stage every time it looks like we might make some progress on the
        “actually do something about it” stage. It’s pretty much the playbook the
        manufacturers of leaded gasoline used back in the day: you don’t need to
        disprove something, you just need to be able to claim the jury’s out long
        enough to keep raking in that sweet, sweet profit.

      > In some ways, it feels like it would be a weirdly poetic end to the journey
        that Lucy failed to begin all those millions of years ago. All that
        exploration, all that progress, all those dreams and grand notions, and that’s
        where we end up: trapped on our planet by a prison we’ve made from our
        own trash.

      > Whatever our future holds, whatever baffling changes come along in the
        next year, the next decade and the next century, it seems likely that we’ll
        keep on doing basically the same things. We will blame other people for our
        woes, and construct elaborate fantasy worlds so that we don’t have to think
        about our sins. We will turn to populist leaders in the aftermath of economic
        crises. We will scramble for money. We will succumb to groupthink and
        manias and confirmation bias. We will tell ourselves that our plans are very
        good plans and that nothing can possibly go wrong.

      > Or...maybe we won’t? Maybe this is the moment that we change, and
        start learning from our history. Maybe all this is just being pessimistic, and
        no matter how dumb and depressing the world today may sometimes seem,
        in actuality humanity is getting wiser and more enlightened, and we are
        lucky enough to live at the dawn of a new age of not fucking up. Maybe we
        really do have the capacity to be better.
