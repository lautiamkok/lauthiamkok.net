      Hill House, not sane, stood by itself against its hills, holding darkness
      within; it had stood so for eighty years and might stand for eighty more.
      Within, walls continued upright, bricks met neatly, floors were firm, and
      doors were sensibly shut; silence lay steadily against the wood and stone of
      Hill House, and whatever walked there, walked alone.
