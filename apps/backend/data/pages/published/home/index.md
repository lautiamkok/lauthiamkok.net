      The teaching and effort of all, of all,
      Philosophies,
      Science,
      Technologies,
      Arts,
      And
      Poetry,
      Is to return us to our origins.
      But, we can't go back as we were,
      We only can become,
      Merely become...
      Ghosts.

      All will pass: our achievements and failures, loves and hatred, religions and science, but this will remain: the wonderer looking into the distance, the mist rising over the horizon.

      ...and all these distances
      become the place I run to
      when the dark rises, when I want
      your ghost to come
      to warm my winter sky
      and watch
      my summer stars.
