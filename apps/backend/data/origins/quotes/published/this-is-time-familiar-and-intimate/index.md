      > This is time, familiar and intimate. We are taken by it. The rush of
      seconds, hours, years that hurls us toward life then drags us toward
      nothingness... We inhabit time as fish live in water. Our being is
      being in time. Its solemn music nurtures us, opens the world to us,
      troubles us, frightens and lulls us. The universe unfolds into the
      future, dragged by time, and exists according to the order of time.

      > Wonder is the source of our desire for knowledge, and the
      discovery that time is not what we thought it was opens up a
      thousand questions [...]

      > And it seems to me that life, this brief life, is nothing other than
      this: the incessant cry of these emotions that drive us, that we
      sometimes attempt to channel in the name of a god, a political faith,
      in a ritual that reassures us that, fundamentally, everything is in
      order, in a great and boundless love—and the cry is beautiful.
      Sometimes it is a cry of pain. Sometimes it is a song.

      > And song, as Augustine observed, is the awareness of time. It is
      time. It is the hymn of the Vedas that is itself the flowering of time.
      In the Benedictus of Beethoven’s Missa Solemnis, the song of the
      violin is pure beauty, pure desperation, pure joy. We are suspended,
      holding our breath, feeling mysteriously that this must be the source
      of meaning. That this is the source of time.

      > Then the song fades and ceases. “The silver thread is broken, the
      golden bowl is shattered, the amphora at the fountain breaks, the
      bucket falls into the well, the earth returns to dust.” And it is fine
      like this. We can close our eyes, rest. This all seems fair and beautiful
      to me. This is time.
