      > ‘All human beings by nature desire knowledge.’ This, the opening sentence
      of the *Metaphysics* (980aI), states a fundamental premise of Aristotle’s
      understanding of what it is to be human. He points out as evidence for his
      claim the pleasure we take in looking at things and assimilating information
      through our senses. Sensation is of course shared with many other animals,
      and the accretion of sensation through memory into experience is shared
      with some. But humans are unique in their capacity to derive universal
      judgements from their experiences. Animals act by instinct or acquired
      habit, but humans are capable of acting from understanding: they know (as
      a dog might know) *that* this is the thing to do in a certain situation, but they
      may also understand (as a dog cannot) *why* it is the thing to do. This is what
      Aristotle calls in Greek *tekhnê*; the word is conventionally translated as
      ‘craft’, ‘skill’ or ‘art’, but Aristotle defines *tekhnê* as a productive capacity
      informed by an understanding of its intrinsic rationale (cf. *Nicomachean
      Ethics*, 1140a20f,). For Aristotle, the evolution of human culture is in large
      part the evolution of *tekhnê*. The first arts which human beings developed
      were those concerned with producing the necessities of their existence.
      Then came recreational arts - those which, while not necessary, enhance the
      quality of human life. In due course, activities arose which simply satisfy
      the desire to know (Aristotle’s example is mathematics). Ultimately,
      philosophy emerged. Philosophy is rooted in the basic human instinct to
      seek knowledge: the world puzzles us and arouses our sense of wonder, and
      so prompts us to look for explanations. Philosophy is therefore the
      sophisticated descendant of primitive myth-making responses to an
      astonishing world.
