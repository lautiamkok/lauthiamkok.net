      > [...]  Parfit disagreed, writing the following in his 1984 book Reasons
      and Persons: “Civilization began only a few thousand years ago. If we do
      not destroy mankind, these few thousand years may be only a tiny fraction
      of the whole of civilized human history. The difference between
      [possibilities] 2 and 3 may thus be the difference between this tiny fraction
      and all of the rest of history.”

      > Extinction, as the environmental slogan goes, is forever.19 The true
      horror of the end of the world is measured not by our own deaths, and the
      deaths of everyone we know and love, not just by the deaths of our children
      and grandchildren, but by the nullification of all who would come after
      them, all those who would live and love and carry this species forward. An
      existential risk realized is the death of the future.

      > People have changed, of course. We’ve largely abandoned hideous
      practices like slavery, expanded the circle of human rights, and fought for
      the power to rule ourselves. But those changes mostly fed the engine of
      growth, and put more power in the hands of individuals, to be used for good
      or ill. Short of a fundamental political or even spiritual revolution, what I
      can’t see changing is that primal human drive to expand.

      > Perhaps I’m suffering from a failure of imagination. The Marxist
      political theorist and literary critic Fredric Jameson, after all, once wrote
      that it is “easier to imagine the end of the world than to imagine the end of
      capitalism.” But everywhere I’ve traveled on this planet, I’ve seen people
      who want more. More for themselves, and more for their children. Who will
      tell them they can’t have it, even if it may cost the world?

      > So we must run faster, as if we’re running for our lives.
