      > Eternity itself may forever lie beyond the reach of our equations, but
      our analyses have already revealed that the universe we have come to know is
      transitory. From planets to stars, solar systems to galaxies, black holes to
      swirling nebulae, nothing is everlasting. Indeed, as far as we can tell, not only
      is each individual life finite, but so too is life itself. Planet earth, which Carl Sagan described as a “mote of dust suspended on a sunbeam,” is an evanescent bloom in an exquisite cosmos that will ultimately be barren. Motes
      of dust, nearby or distant, dance on sunbeams for merely a moment.

      > Still, here on earth we have punctuated our moment with astonishing feats
      of insight, creativity, and ingenuity as each generation has built on the
      achievements of those who have gone before, seeking clarity on how it all
      came to be, pursuing coherence in where it is all going, and longing for an
      answer to why it all matters.

      > As we hurtle toward a cold and barren cosmos, we must accept that there
      is no grand design. Particles are not endowed with purpose. There is no final
      answer hovering in the depths of space awaiting discovery. Instead, certain
      special collections of particles can think and feel and reflect, and within these
      subjective worlds they can create purpose. And so, in our quest to fathom the
      human condition, the only direction to look is inward. That is the noble
      direction to look. It is a direction that forgoes ready-made answers and turns
      to the highly personal journey of constructing our own meaning. It is a
      direction that leads to the very heart of creative expression and the source of
      our most resonant narratives. Science is a powerful, exquisite tool for grasping
      an external reality. But within that rubric, within that understanding,
      everything else is the human species contemplating itself, grasping what it
      needs to carry on, and telling a story that reverberates into the darkness, a
      story carved of sound and etched into silence, a story that, at its best, stirs the
      soul.
