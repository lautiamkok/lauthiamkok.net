In these spaces, we feel time's elasticity as acutely as one who, alone in the house in the late evening, awaits the return of his beloved, in a state in which all other spiritual activity has ceased. He is, as the Chinese say, 'looking at the door', trusting that soon the key will grate in the lock, the handle turn, an the waiting, which can now be forgotten, be at an end. The power that radiates from this moment illuminates for a time the whole perceptual world. It recompenses the the one who waited with the news that the waiting wasn't in vain, and it exercises its own untriumphal victory over the other emotions. A world glistening with joy is a world that can easily do without fear, without anger, disgust and jealousy, and a world that can do without these is a world worth living in.\n\nStuart Walton, [Humanity: An Emotional History](https://amzn.to/3ndo04y \"Humanity: An Emotional History\"), 2004. {.line-before}\n"

          "contents": "> ‘All human beings by nature desire knowledge.’ This, the opening sentence\nof the *Metaphysics* (980aI), states a fundamental premise of Aristotle’s\nunderstanding of what it is to be human. He points out as evidence for his\nclaim the pleasure we take in looking at things and assimilating information\nthrough our senses. Sensation is of course shared with many other animals,\nand the accretion of sensation through memory into experience is shared\nwith some. But humans are unique in their capacity to derive universal\njudgements from their experiences. Animals act by instinct or acquired\nhabit, but humans are capable of acting from understanding: they know (as\na dog might know) *that* this is the thing to do in a certain situation, but they\nmay also understand (as a dog cannot) *why* it is the thing to do. This is what\nAristotle calls in Greek *tekhnê*; the word is conventionally translated as\n‘craft’, ‘skill’ or ‘art’, but Aristotle defines *tekhnê* as a productive capacity\ninformed by an understanding of its intrinsic rationale (cf. *Nicomachean\nEthics*, 1140a20f,). For Aristotle, the evolution of human culture is in large\npart the evolution of *tekhnê*. The first arts which human beings developed\nwere those concerned with producing the necessities of their existence.\nThen came recreational arts - those which, while not necessary, enhance the\nquality of human life. In due course, activities arose which simply satisfy\nthe desire to know (Aristotle’s example is mathematics). Ultimately,\nphilosophy emerged. Philosophy is rooted in the basic human instinct to\nseek knowledge: the world puzzles us and arouses our sense of wonder, and\nso prompts us to look for explanations. Philosophy is therefore the\nsophisticated descendant of primitive myth-making responses to an\nastonishing world.\n\nMalcolm Heath, [Poetics  (Penguin Classics)](https://amzn.to/3qANAmi \"Poetics  (Penguin Classics)\"), 1996. {.line-before}\n"

We’re way beyond the\n  point where this might all be another polywater or N-ray-type situation that\n  everybody’s going to be embarrassed about in a few years’ time. And yet\n  apparently there are still plenty of people who have enough reasons to deny\n  it—financial, political, the sheer bloody-minded joy of being a contrarian\n  knobber—that we keep getting dragged back to the “debate about whether\n  it’s real” stage every time it looks like we might make some progress on the\n  “actually do something about it” stage. It’s pretty much the playbook the\n  manufacturers of leaded gasoline used back in the day: you don’t need to\n  disprove something, you just need to be able to claim the jury’s out long\n  enough to keep raking in that sweet, sweet profit.\n\n> In some ways, it feels like it would be a weirdly poetic end to the journey\n  that Lucy failed to begin all those millions of years ago.

We will blame other people for our\n  woes, and construct elaborate fantasy worlds so that we don’t have to think\n  about our sins. We will turn to populist leaders in the aftermath of economic\n  crises. We will scramble for money. We will succumb to groupthink and\n  manias and confirmation bias. We will tell ourselves that our plans are very\n  good plans and that nothing can possibly go wrong.\n\n> Or...maybe we won’t? Maybe this is the moment that we change, and\n  start learning from our history. Maybe all this is just being pessimistic, and\n  no matter how dumb and depressing the world today may sometimes seem,\n  in actuality humanity is getting wiser and more enlightened, and we are\n  lucky enough to live at the dawn of a new age of not fucking up.

From planets to stars, solar systems to galaxies, black holes to\nswirling nebulae, nothing is everlasting. Indeed, as far as we can tell, not only\nis each individual life finite, but so too is life itself. Planet earth, which Carl Sagan described as a “mote of dust suspended on a sunbeam,” is an evanescent bloom in an exquisite cosmos that will ultimately be barren. Motes\nof dust, nearby or distant, dance on sunbeams for merely a moment.\n\n> Still, here on earth we have punctuated our moment with astonishing feats\nof insight, creativity, and ingenuity as each generation has built on the\nachievements of those who have gone before, seeking clarity on how it all\ncame to be, pursuing coherence in where it is all going, and longing for an\nanswer to why it all matters.\n\n> As we hurtle toward a cold and barren cosmos, we must accept that there\nis no grand design. Particles are not endowed with purpose. There is no final\nanswer hovering in the depths of space awaiting discovery. Instead, certain\nspecial collections of particles can think and feel and reflect, and within these\nsubjective worlds they can create purpose. And so, in our quest to fathom the\nhuman condition, the only direction to look is inward. That is the noble\ndirection to look. It is a direction that forgoes ready-made answers and turns\nto the highly personal journey of constructing our own meaning. It is a\ndirection that leads to the very heart of creative expression and the source of\nour most resonant narratives. Science is a powerful, exquisite tool for grasping\nan external reality. But within that rubric, within that understanding,\neverything else is the human species contemplating itself, grasping what it\nneeds to carry on, and telling a story that reverberates into the darkness, a\nstory carved of sound and etched into silence, a story that, at its best, stirs the\nsoul.\n\nBrian Greene, [Until the End of Time](https://amzn.to/3wIiBpb \"Until the End of Time: Mind, Matter, and Our Search for Meaning in an Evolving Universe\"), 2020. {.line-before}\n"

In a cosmic perspective, most human concerns seem insignificant, even petty. And yet our species is young and curious and brave and shows much promise. In the last few millennia we have made the most astonishing and unexpected discoveries about the Cosmos and our place within it, explorations that are exhilarating to consider. They remind us that humans have evolved to wonder, that understanding is a joy, that knowledge is prerequisite to survival. I believe our future depends on how well we know this Cosmos in which we float like a mote of dust in the morning sky.\n\n> Those explorations required skepticism and imagination both. Imagination will often carry us to worlds that never were. But without it, we go nowhere. Skepticism enables us to distinguish fancy from fact, to test our speculations. The Cosmos is rich beyond measure - in elegant facts, in exquisite interrelationships, in the subtle machinery of awe.\n\n> As long as there have been humans, we have searched for our place in the Cosmos. In the childhood of our species (when our ancestors gazed a little idly at the stars), among the Ionian scientists of ancient Greece, and in our own age, we have been transfixed by this question: Where are we? Who are we? We find that we live on an insignificant planet of a humdrum star lost between two spiral arms in the outskirts of a galaxy which is a member of a sparse cluster of galaxies, tucked away in some forgotten corner of a universe in which there are far more galaxies than people. This perspective is a courageous continuation of our penchant for constructing and testing mental models of the skies; the Sun as a red-hot stone, the stars as celestial flame, the Galaxy as the backbone of night.\n\n> We embarked on our cosmic voyage with a question first framed in the childhood of our species and in each generation asked anew with undiminished wonder: What are the stars? Exploration is in our nature. We began as wanderers, and we are wanderers still. We have lingered long enough on the shores of the cosmic ocean. We are ready at last to set sail for the stars.\n\n> For we are the local embodiment of a Cosmos grown to self-\nawareness. We have begun to contemplate our origins: starstuff\npondering the stars; organized assemblages of ten billion billion\nbillion atoms considering the evolution of atoms; tracing the long\njourney by which, here at least, consciousness arose. Our loyal­\nties are to the species and the planet. We speak for Earth. Our\nobligation to survive is owed not just to ourselves but also to that\nCosmos, ancient and vast, from which we spring.\n\nCarl Sagan, [Cosmos: The Story of Cosmic Evolution, Science and Civilisation](https://amzn.to/3C6YQc8 \"Cosmos: The Story of Cosmic Evolution, Science and Civilisation\"), 1980. {.line-before}\n"

It's an arrangement so specialized and particular that it has never\nbeen tried before and will only exist this once.\n\n> Why atoms take this trouble is a bit of a puzzle. Being you is not a\ngratifying experience at the atomic level. For all their devoted attention,\nyour atoms don't actually care about you—indeed, don't even know that you\nare there. They don't even know that they are there. They are mindless\nparticles, after all, and not even themselves alive.\n\n> [...] And when that modest milestone flashes past, or at some\nother point thereabouts, for reasons unknown your atoms will shut you\ndown, silently disassemble, and go off to be other things. And that's it for\nyou.\n\n> Still, you may rejoice that it happens at all. Generally speaking in the\nuniverse it doesn't, so far as we can tell. This is decidedly odd because the\natoms that so liberally and congenially flock together to form living things\non Earth are exactly the same atoms that decline to do it elsewhere.\nWhatever else it may be, at the level of chemistry life is curiously mundane:\ncarbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen, a little calcium, a dash of sulfur, a\nlight dusting of other very ordinary elements—nothing you wouldn't find in\nany ordinary drugstore—and that's all you need. The only thing special\nabout the atoms that make you is that they make you. That is of course the\nmiracle of life.\n\n> So thank goodness for atoms. But the fact that you have atoms and that\nthey assemble in such a willing manner is only part of what got you here.\nTo be here now, alive in the twenty-first century and smart enough to know\nit, you also had to be the beneficiary of an extraordinary string of biological\ngood fortune [...] Life on Earth,\nyou see, is not only brief but dismayingly tenuous. It is a curious feature of\nour existence that we come from a planet that is very good at promoting life\nbut even better at extinguishing it.\n\n> If this book has a lesson, it is that we are awfully lucky to be here—and\nby “we” I mean every living thing. To attain any kind of life in this universe\nof ours appears to be quite an achievement. As humans we are doubly\nlucky, of course: We enjoy not only the privilege of existence but also the\nsingular ability to appreciate it and even, in a multitude of ways, to make it\nbetter. It is a talent we have only barely begun to grasp.\n\n> We have arrived at this position of eminence in a stunningly short time.\nBehaviorally modern human beings—that is, people who can speak and\nmake art and organize complex activities—have existed for only about\n0.0001 percent of Earth's history. But surviving for even that little while has\nrequired a nearly endless string of good fortune.\n\n> We really are at the beginning of it all. The trick, of course, is to make\nsure we never find the end. And that, almost certainly, will require a good\ndeal more than lucky breaks.\n\nBill Bryson, [A Short History of Nearly Everything](https://amzn.to/3DpElZq \"A Short History of Nearly Everything: A Journey Through Space and Time\"), 2003. {.line-before}\n"

The difference between\n[possibilities] 2 and 3 may thus be the difference between this tiny fraction\nand all of the rest of history.”\n\n> Extinction, as the environmental slogan goes, is forever.19 The true\nhorror of the end of the world is measured not by our own deaths, and the\ndeaths of everyone we know and love, not just by the deaths of our children\nand grandchildren, but by the nullification of all who would come after\nthem, all those who would live and love and carry this species forward. An\nexistential risk realized is the death of the future.\n\n> People have changed, of course. We’ve largely abandoned hideous\npractices like slavery, expanded the circle of human rights, and fought for\nthe power to rule ourselves. But those changes mostly fed the engine of\ngrowth, and put more power in the hands of individuals, to be used for good\nor ill. Short of a fundamental political or even spiritual revolution, what I\ncan’t see changing is that primal human drive to expand.\n\n> Perhaps I’m suffering from a failure of imagination. The Marxist\npolitical theorist and literary critic Fredric Jameson, after all, once wrote\nthat it is “easier to imagine the end of the world than to imagine the end of\ncapitalism.” But everywhere I’ve traveled on this planet, I’ve seen people\nwho want more.

We inhabit time as fish live in water. Our being is\nbeing in time. Its solemn music nurtures us, opens the world to us,\ntroubles us, frightens and lulls us. The universe unfolds into the\nfuture, dragged by time, and exists according to the order of time.\n\n> Wonder is the source of our desire for knowledge, and the\ndiscovery that time is not what we thought it was opens up a\nthousand questions [...]\n\n> And it seems to me that life, this brief life, is nothing other than\nthis: the incessant cry of these emotions that drive us, that we\nsometimes attempt to channel in the name of a god, a political faith,\nin a ritual that reassures us that, fundamentally, everything is in\norder, in a great and boundless love—and the cry is beautiful.\nSometimes it is a cry of pain. Sometimes it is a song.\n\n> And song, as Augustine observed, is the awareness of time. It is\ntime. It is the hymn of the Vedas that is itself the flowering of time.\nIn the Benedictus of Beethoven’s Missa Solemnis, the song of the\nviolin is pure beauty, pure desperation, pure joy. We are suspended,\nholding our breath, feeling mysteriously that this must be the source\nof meaning. That this is the source of time.\n\n> Then the song fades and ceases. “The silver thread is broken, the\ngolden bowl is shattered, the amphora at the fountain breaks, the\nbucket falls into the well, the earth returns to dust.” And it is fine\nlike this. We can close our eyes, rest. This all seems fair and beautiful\nto me. This is time.\n\nCarlo Rovelli, [The Order of Time](https://amzn.to/30jF8ND \"The Order of Time\"), . {.line-before}\n"

But whereas pride usually develop into a massive sentiment that weighs upon the entire psyche, the touch of pride that is born of adherence to the felicity of an image, remains secret and unobtrusive. It is with within us, mere readers that we are, it is for us, and for us alone. It is a homely sort of pride. Nobody knows that in reading we are re-living our temptations to be poet. All readers who have a certain passion for reading, nurture and repress, though reading, the desire to become a writer. When the page we have just read is too near perfection, our modesty suppresses this desire. But it reappears, nevertheless. In any case, every reader who re-reads a work that he likes, knows that its pages concern him.\n\nGaston Bachelard, [The Poetics of Space](https://amzn.to/3FbyK9D \"The Poetics of Space\"), 1958. {.line-before}\n"

          "contents": "> Our universe is dotted ‘with over 100 billion galaxies, and each one\ncontains roughly 100 billion stars. It is unclear how many planets are\norbiting these stars, but it is certain that at least one of them has evolved\nlife. In particular, there is a life form that has had the capacity and audacity\nto speculate about the origin of this vast universe.\n\n> Humans have been staring up into space for thousands of generations,\nbut we are privileged to be part of the first generation who can claim to\nhave a respectable, rational and coherent description for the creation and\nevolution of the universe. The Big Bang model offers an elegant\nexplanation of the origin of everything we see in the night sky, making it\none of the greatest achievements of the human intellect and spirit. It is the\nconsequence of an insatiable curiosity, a fabulous imagination, acute\nobservation and ruthless logic.\n\n> According to a Chinese creation myth that dates to 600 BC, Phan Ku the\nGiant Creator emerged from an egg and proceeded to create the world by\nusing a chisel to carve valleys and mountains from the landscape. Next, he\nset the Sun, Moon and stars in the sky; he died as soon as these tasks were\nfinished. The death of the Giant Creator was an essential part of the creation\nprocess, because fragments of his own body helped to complete the world.\nPhan Ku’s skull formed the dome of sky, his flesh formed the soil, his bones\nbecame rocks and his blood created rivers and seas. The last of his breath\nforged the wind and clouds, while his sweat became rain. His hair fell to\nEarth, creating plant life, and the fleas that had lodged in his hair provided\nthe basis for the human race. As our birth required the death of our creator,\nwe were to be cursed with sorrow forever after.\n\n> Unfortunately, the scientific community has to admit that all these possible answers, from rebounding universes to spontaneous quantum creation, are highly speculative and do not yet properly address the ultimate question of where the universe came from. Nevertheless, the current generation of cosmologists should not be downhearted. They should rejoice in the fact that the Big Bang model is a coherent and consistent description of our universe. They should be proud that the Big Bang model is a pinnacle of human achievement, because it explains so much of the universe’s present by revealing its past. They should go out and tell the world that the Big Bang model is a tribute to human curiosity and our intellect. And if a member of the public should ask the toughest question of all, ‘What came before the Big Bang?’, then they might consider following St Augustine’s example.\n\n> In his autobiography, Confessions, written in about AD 400, the philosopher and theologian St Augustine quotes an answer he has heard to the theological equivalent of ‘What came before the Big Bang?’: What was God doing before He created the Universe? Before He created Heaven and Earth, God created hell to be used for people such as you who ask this kind of question.\n\nSimon Singh, [Big Bang: The Origin of the Universe](https://amzn.to/3oq8f9P \"Big Bang: The Origin of the Universe\"), 2004. {.line-before}\n"
