If you can wait
I can grow up
to speak all words
you have waited to hear.

If you can wait
until I am old enough
to understand the world
I can tell you
in a word of wisdom
for all words
you have waited me
to understand.

If you can wait
like the world
has waited for me
to learn to tell
all words about you,
I can promise
to let you see one day
all the harvest
we have waited for.
