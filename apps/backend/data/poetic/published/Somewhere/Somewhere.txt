I believe
I have to live
so that I can make
a worthwhile
for this life.

I believe
I have to learn
so that all this
teaches me a belief
that somewhere
you have been there
all the way.

I believe
I have to go on
to leave hold
to go far
so that I can
meet you somewhere
someplace
one day.
