If I could outrun my body
I would fly to all the mountains on Earth
I would fly to the Moon, to Mars, to Pluto...

I would swim around the Black Holes
I would watch the birth of Stars
I would touch the edge of the Universe

I would go beyond the End
to the absolute Darkness
to find the infinite Eternity.
