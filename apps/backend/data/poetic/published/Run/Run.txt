I wonder
if there is an express
which I can get on
to travel me
to a journey of life
where there is no horizon
where I can run and run.

I wonder
if there is a night
where I can run to and live on
which never lets me down
where there are the moon and the constellations
to deliver me
to a river of dreams
where it never will be awakened by daybreak.

And I wonder
is there a place
where there is a life I will run into
let me rest
and no matter where it will take me
if you ask me,
"Will you go with me?"
I'll say,
"Yes I will!
Yes I will!"
