I want to go to you
for happiness.
I will grow up and fly high
to search for your face
in the sea of clouds
in the seamless sky.
You must be there.

I want to go to you
for happiness.
However the road grows dark
however the night grows cold
I will walk alone
in the sea of desert
in this seamless night.
I must find you.

I want to go to you
for happiness.
Every day I grow tall
and strong and taugh;
every night I grow this faith
in the sea of stars
in this seamless life.
I must grow up and fly away
then I will find you.
