How do you live
My dearest ghost?
The grass you used to tread
Still green in Spring
Do you know?
The sky you used to wander
Rains like old days
Do you know?
I am worried about money
Struggling to make the ends meet
Do you know?
Maybe you do live with me
Eat my food, wear my cloths
Grieve me and
Make me skint.
