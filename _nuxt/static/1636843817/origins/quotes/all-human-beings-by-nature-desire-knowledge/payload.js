He points out as evidence for his\nclaim the pleasure we take in looking at things and assimilating information\nthrough our senses. Sensation is of course shared with many other animals,\nand the accretion of sensation through memory into experience is shared\nwith some. But humans are unique in their capacity to derive universal\njudgements from their experiences. Animals act by instinct or acquired\nhabit, but humans are capable of acting from understanding: they know (as\na dog might know) *that* this is the thing to do in a certain situation, but they\nmay also understand (as a dog cannot) *why* it is the thing to do. This is what\nAristotle calls in Greek *tekhnê*; the word is conventionally translated as\n‘craft’, ‘skill’ or ‘art’, but Aristotle defines *tekhnê* as a productive capacity\ninformed by an understanding of its intrinsic rationale (cf. *Nicomachean\nEthics*, 1140a20f,). For Aristotle, the evolution of human culture is in large\npart the evolution of *tekhnê*. The first arts which human beings developed\nwere those concerned with producing the necessities of their existence.\nThen came recreational arts - those which, while not necessary, enhance the\nquality of human life. In due course, activities arose which simply satisfy\nthe desire to know (Aristotle’s example is mathematics). Ultimately,\nphilosophy emerged. Philosophy is rooted in the basic human instinct to\nseek knowledge: the world puzzles us and arouses our sense of wonder, and\nso prompts us to look for explanations. Philosophy is therefore the\nsophisticated descendant of primitive myth-making responses to an\nastonishing world.\n\nMalcolm Heath, [Poetics  (Penguin Classics)](https:\u002F\u002Famzn.to\u002F3qANAmi \"Poetics  (Penguin Classics)\"), 1996. {.line-before}\n",image:a}],fontSizes:a,headImage:a,adImage:{file:"51rxDzC74yL._SX321_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg",title:d,alt:a,caption:e,link:"https:\u002F\u002Famzn.to\u002F3qANAmi",cellClass:"medium-6",figcaptionGridClass:"small-padding-collapse",figcaptionCellClass:a},fullSingleHead:{gridClass:"dark-mode image-background",cellClass:"large-5",bgStyle:a,bgImage:g,content:"\u003E All human beings by nature desire knowledge.\n\n Aristotle in [Poetics  (Penguin Classics)](https:\u002F\u002Famzn.to\u002F3qANAmi \"Poetics  (Penguin Classics)\"), by Malcolm Heath, 1996. {.line-before}\n",imgCaption:"\u003Cspan\u003EPhoto by \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Funsplash.com\u002F@marioklassen?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText\"\u003EMario Klassen\u003C\u002Fa\u003E on \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Funsplash.com\u002Fs\u002Fphotos\u002Fstudy-room?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText\"\u003EUnsplash\u003C\u002Fa\u003E\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\n"},fullSplitHeadLeft:a,fullSplitHeadRight:a,relatedPages:a}}],fetch:[],mutations:[["setAdvert",h],["setSponsor",h]]}}(null,"article","quotes","Poetics  (Penguin Classics)","","true","mario-klassen-dYswqbzvopw-unsplash.jpg",true)));
