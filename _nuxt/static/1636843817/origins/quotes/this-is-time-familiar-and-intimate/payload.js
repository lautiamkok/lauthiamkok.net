We are taken by it. The rush of\nseconds, hours, years that hurls us toward life then drags us toward\nnothingness... We inhabit time as fish live in water. Our being is\nbeing in time. Its solemn music nurtures us, opens the world to us,\ntroubles us, frightens and lulls us. The universe unfolds into the\nfuture, dragged by time, and exists according to the order of time.\n\n\u003E Wonder is the source of our desire for knowledge, and the\ndiscovery that time is not what we thought it was opens up a\nthousand questions [...]\n\n\u003E And it seems to me that life, this brief life, is nothing other than\nthis: the incessant cry of these emotions that drive us, that we\nsometimes attempt to channel in the name of a god, a political faith,\nin a ritual that reassures us that, fundamentally, everything is in\norder, in a great and boundless love—and the cry is beautiful.\nSometimes it is a cry of pain. Sometimes it is a song.\n\n\u003E And song, as Augustine observed, is the awareness of time. It is\ntime. It is the hymn of the Vedas that is itself the flowering of time.\nIn the Benedictus of Beethoven’s Missa Solemnis, the song of the\nviolin is pure beauty, pure desperation, pure joy. We are suspended,\nholding our breath, feeling mysteriously that this must be the source\nof meaning. That this is the source of time.\n\n\u003E Then the song fades and ceases. “The silver thread is broken, the\ngolden bowl is shattered, the amphora at the fountain breaks, the\nbucket falls into the well, the earth returns to dust.” And it is fine\nlike this. We can close our eyes, rest. This all seems fair and beautiful\nto me. This is time.\n\nCarlo Rovelli, [The Order of Time](https:\u002F\u002Famzn.to\u002F30jF8ND \"The Order of Time\"), . {.line-before}\n",image:a}],fontSizes:a,headImage:a,adImage:{file:"51qOa+wz2nL._SX323_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg",title:d,alt:a,caption:"The Order of Time – by Carlo Rovelli\n",link:"https:\u002F\u002Famzn.to\u002F30jF8ND",cellClass:"medium-6",figcaptionGridClass:"small-padding-collapse",figcaptionCellClass:a},fullSingleHead:{gridClass:"dark-mode image-background",cellClass:"large-6",bgStyle:"'background-position': 'center center'\n",bgImage:f,content:"\u003E This is time, familiar and intimate.
