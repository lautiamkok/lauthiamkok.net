If we do\nnot destroy mankind, these few thousand years may be only a tiny fraction\nof the whole of civilized human history. The difference between\n[possibilities] 2 and 3 may thus be the difference between this tiny fraction\nand all of the rest of history.”\n\n\u003E Extinction, as the environmental slogan goes, is forever.19 The true\nhorror of the end of the world is measured not by our own deaths, and the\ndeaths of everyone we know and love, not just by the deaths of our children\nand grandchildren, but by the nullification of all who would come after\nthem, all those who would live and love and carry this species forward. An\nexistential risk realized is the death of the future.\n\n\u003E People have changed, of course. We’ve largely abandoned hideous\npractices like slavery, expanded the circle of human rights, and fought for\nthe power to rule ourselves. But those changes mostly fed the engine of\ngrowth, and put more power in the hands of individuals, to be used for good\nor ill. Short of a fundamental political or even spiritual revolution, what I\ncan’t see changing is that primal human drive to expand.\n\n\u003E Perhaps I’m suffering from a failure of imagination. The Marxist\npolitical theorist and literary critic Fredric Jameson, after all, once wrote\nthat it is “easier to imagine the end of the world than to imagine the end of\ncapitalism.” But everywhere I’ve traveled on this planet, I’ve seen people\nwho want more. More for themselves, and more for their children. Who will\ntell them they can’t have it, even if it may cost the world?\n\n\u003E So we must run faster, as if we’re running for our lives.\n\nBryan Walsh, [End Times](https:\u002F\u002Famzn.to\u002F30rkCum \"End Times: A Brief Guide to the End of the World\"), 2019. {.line-before}\n",image:a}],fontSizes:a,headImage:a,adImage:{file:"514Dw3K8TKL._SX324_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg",title:"End Times: A Brief Guide to the End of the World",alt:a,caption:"End Times: A Brief Guide to the End of the World – by Bryan Walsh\n",link:"https:\u002F\u002Famzn.to\u002F30rkCum",cellClass:"medium-6",figcaptionGridClass:"small-padding-collapse",figcaptionCellClass:a},fullSingleHead:{gridClass:"dark-mode image-background",cellClass:"large-6",bgStyle:"'background-position': 'center center'\n",bgImage:e,content:"\u003E It is easier to imagine the end of the world than to imagine the end of capitalism.\n\nBryan Walsh, [End Times](https:\u002F\u002Famzn.to\u002F30rkCum \"End Times: A Brief Guide to the End of the World\"), 2019. {.line-before}\n",imgCaption:"\u003Cspan\u003EPhoto by \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Funsplash.com\u002F@neilmarkthomas?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText\"\u003ENeil Thomas\u003C\u002Fa\u003E on \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Funsplash.com\u002Fcollections\u002F11456707\u002Fnature?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText\"\u003EUnsplash\u003C\u002Fa\u003E\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\n"},fullSplitHeadLeft:a,fullSplitHeadRight:a,relatedPages:a}}],fetch:[],mutations:[["setAdvert",f],["setSponsor",f]]}}(null,"article","quotes","true","neil-thomas-NjvkwbzYrew-unsplash.jpg",true)));
