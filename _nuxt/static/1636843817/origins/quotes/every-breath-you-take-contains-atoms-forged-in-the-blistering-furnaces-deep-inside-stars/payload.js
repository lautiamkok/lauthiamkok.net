The atoms forged long ago in the fireball of the big bang, in countless stars across the length and breadth of the galaxy, became incorporated into human beings. They became, in short, the atoms of curiosity.\n\n\u003E Now, why should the universe be constructed in such a way that atoms acquire the ability to be curious about themselves? That, surely, is one of the greatest unexplained puzzles of science.\n\nMarcus Chown, [The Magic Furnace](https:\u002F\u002Famzn.to\u002F3wJTB0R \"The Magic Furnace\"), 1999. {.line-before}\n",image:a}],fontSizes:a,headImage:a,adImage:{file:"51JqHLZ80CL._SX321_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg",title:d,alt:a,caption:e,link:"https:\u002F\u002Famzn.to\u002F3wJTB0R",cellClass:"medium-6",figcaptionGridClass:"small-padding-collapse",figcaptionCellClass:a},fullSingleHead:{gridClass:"dark-mode image-background",cellClass:"large-6",bgStyle:a,bgImage:g,content:"\u003E Every breath you take contains atoms forged in the blistering furnaces deep inside stars.
