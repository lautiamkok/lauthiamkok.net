We’re way beyond the\n  point where this might all be another polywater or N-ray-type situation that\n  everybody’s going to be embarrassed about in a few years’ time. And yet\n  apparently there are still plenty of people who have enough reasons to deny\n  it—financial, political, the sheer bloody-minded joy of being a contrarian\n  knobber—that we keep getting dragged back to the “debate about whether\n  it’s real” stage every time it looks like we might make some progress on the\n  “actually do something about it” stage. It’s pretty much the playbook the\n  manufacturers of leaded gasoline used back in the day: you don’t need to\n  disprove something, you just need to be able to claim the jury’s out long\n  enough to keep raking in that sweet, sweet profit.\n\n\u003E In some ways, it feels like it would be a weirdly poetic end to the journey\n  that Lucy failed to begin all those millions of years ago. All that\n  exploration, all that progress, all those dreams and grand notions, and that’s\n  where we end up: trapped on our planet by a prison we’ve made from our\n  own trash.\n\n\u003E Whatever our future holds, whatever baffling changes come along in the\n  next year, the next decade and the next century, it seems likely that we’ll\n  keep on doing basically the same things. We will blame other people for our\n  woes, and construct elaborate fantasy worlds so that we don’t have to think\n  about our sins. We will turn to populist leaders in the aftermath of economic\n  crises. We will scramble for money. We will succumb to groupthink and\n  manias and confirmation bias. We will tell ourselves that our plans are very\n  good plans and that nothing can possibly go wrong.\n\n\u003E Or...maybe we won’t? Maybe this is the moment that we change, and\n  start learning from our history. Maybe all this is just being pessimistic, and\n  no matter how dumb and depressing the world today may sometimes seem,\n  in actuality humanity is getting wiser and more enlightened, and we are\n  lucky enough to live at the dawn of a new age of not fucking up. Maybe we\n  really do have the capacity to be better.\n\nTom Phillips, [Humans](https:\u002F\u002Famzn.to\u002F2DztVNm \"Humans: A Brief History of How We F*cked It All Up\"), 2018. {.line-before}\n",image:a}],fontSizes:a,headImage:a,adImage:{file:"41H75UarOdL._SX325_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg",title:"Humans: A Brief History of How We F*cked It All Up",alt:a,caption:"Humans: A Brief History of How We F*cked It All Up – by Tom Phillips\n",link:"https:\u002F\u002Famzn.to\u002F2DztVNm",cellClass:"medium-6",figcaptionGridClass:"small-padding-collapse",figcaptionCellClass:a},fullSingleHead:{gridClass:"dark-mode image-background",cellClass:"large-6",bgStyle:"'background-position': 'center center'\n",bgImage:e,content:"\u003E All that\nexploration, all that progress, all those dreams and grand notions, and that’s\nwhere we end up: trapped on our planet by a prison we’ve made from our\nown trash.\n\nTom Phillips, [Humans](https:\u002F\u002Famzn.to\u002F2DztVNm \"Humans: A Brief History of How We F*cked It All Up\"), 2018. {.line-before}\n",imgCaption:"\u003Cspan\u003EPhoto by \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Funsplash.com\u002F@clesulie?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText\"\u003ECollins Lesulie\u003C\u002Fa\u003E on \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Funsplash.com\u002Fcollections\u002F11456707\u002Fnature?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText\"\u003EUnsplash\u003C\u002Fa\u003E\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\n"},fullSplitHeadLeft:a,fullSplitHeadRight:a,relatedPages:a}}],fetch:[],mutations:[["setAdvert",f],["setSponsor",f]]}}(null,"article","quotes","true","collins-lesulie--OZcGk5lD7U-unsplash.jpg",true)));
