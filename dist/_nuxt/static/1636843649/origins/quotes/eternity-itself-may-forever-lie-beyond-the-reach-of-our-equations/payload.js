From planets to stars, solar systems to galaxies, black holes to\nswirling nebulae, nothing is everlasting. Indeed, as far as we can tell, not only\nis each individual life finite, but so too is life itself. Planet earth, which Carl Sagan described as a “mote of dust suspended on a sunbeam,” is an evanescent bloom in an exquisite cosmos that will ultimately be barren. Motes\nof dust, nearby or distant, dance on sunbeams for merely a moment.\n\n\u003E Still, here on earth we have punctuated our moment with astonishing feats\nof insight, creativity, and ingenuity as each generation has built on the\nachievements of those who have gone before, seeking clarity on how it all\ncame to be, pursuing coherence in where it is all going, and longing for an\nanswer to why it all matters.\n\n\u003E As we hurtle toward a cold and barren cosmos, we must accept that there\nis no grand design. Particles are not endowed with purpose. There is no final\nanswer hovering in the depths of space awaiting discovery. Instead, certain\nspecial collections of particles can think and feel and reflect, and within these\nsubjective worlds they can create purpose. And so, in our quest to fathom the\nhuman condition, the only direction to look is inward. That is the noble\ndirection to look. It is a direction that forgoes ready-made answers and turns\nto the highly personal journey of constructing our own meaning. It is a\ndirection that leads to the very heart of creative expression and the source of\nour most resonant narratives. Science is a powerful, exquisite tool for grasping\nan external reality. But within that rubric, within that understanding,\neverything else is the human species contemplating itself, grasping what it\nneeds to carry on, and telling a story that reverberates into the darkness, a\nstory carved of sound and etched into silence, a story that, at its best, stirs the\nsoul.\n\nBrian Greene, [Until the End of Time](https:\u002F\u002Famzn.to\u002F3wIiBpb \"Until the End of Time: Mind, Matter, and Our Search for Meaning in an Evolving Universe\"), 2020. {.line-before}\n",image:a}],fontSizes:a,headImage:a,adImage:{file:"51keovPHkHL._SX321_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg",title:"Until the End of Time: Mind, Matter, and Our Search for Meaning in an Evolving Universe",alt:a,caption:"Until the End of Time: Mind, Matter, and Our Search for Meaning in an Evolving Universe – by Brian Greene\n",link:"https:\u002F\u002Famzn.to\u002F3wIiBpb",cellClass:"medium-6",figcaptionGridClass:"small-padding-collapse",figcaptionCellClass:a},fullSingleHead:{gridClass:"dark-mode image-background",cellClass:"large-6",bgStyle:"'background-position': 'top center'\n",bgImage:e,content:"\u003E Eternity itself may forever lie beyond the reach of our equations, but\n  our analyses have already revealed that the universe we have come to know is\n  transitory.\n\nBrian Greene, [Until the End of Time](https:\u002F\u002Famzn.to\u002F3wIiBpb \"Until the End of Time: Mind, Matter, and Our Search for Meaning in an Evolving Universe\"), 2020. {.line-before}\n",imgCaption:"\u003Cspan\u003EPhoto by \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Funsplash.com\u002F@sandalkuilang?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText\"\u003EHendra Yudha Pratama\u003C\u002Fa\u003E on \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Funsplash.com\u002Fs\u002Fphotos\u002Fstars?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText\"\u003EUnsplash\u003C\u002Fa\u003E\u003C\u002Fspan\u003E\n"},fullSplitHeadLeft:a,fullSplitHeadRight:a,relatedPages:a}}],fetch:[],mutations:[["setAdvert",f],["setSponsor",f]]}}(null,"article","quotes","true","hendra-yudha-pratama-rDOS8pI6vLQ-unsplash.jpg",true)));
