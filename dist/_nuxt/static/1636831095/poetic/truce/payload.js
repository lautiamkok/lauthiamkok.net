We were passing by an English primary school and she told her friend that she would like to send me to that English school to study, speak English, and go abroad someday. I was petrified, I didn't want to go to the English school. I didn't want to speak English. I didn't want to go abroad. I begged her not to send me to that school. She said I must. She didn't send me to the English school in the end. I was just sent to a Chinese school nearby the hill we lived. I was pleased and relieved. But still, I grew up trying to achieve what she had hoped for in that afternoon. I knew it was her dream to acquire knowledge if she wasn't confined by the old society. Those old ideas. Those she had to live by...\r\u003Cbr \u002F\u003E\r\u003Cbr \u002F\u003ESo she set her dream on me. She extended herself into me. And that sometimes I wonder: is it my dream or hers? Am I dreaming or is she dreaming through me? Or both - we are dreaming the same dreams? It seems that she hasn't realised that she is already lied six feet under. Or maybe deep inside me never realised that as I was stranded abroad and did not attend her funeral. I was only informed about it. Saw some videos and pictures. I never held her cold body up from the floor that took her life. I can never know how it was like to hold her for one last time, to say the last goodbye. I only can imagine.\r\u003Cbr \u002F\u003E\r\u003Cbr \u002F\u003ESo since then, she has lived inside my dreams instead. She seems fine. Lives well. Does what she likes to do. Never ages a day. Only at times, she turns into a raging beast agonizing over her death whenever she finds out that she has already died. Petrified and wailing in my dreams, waking up in me with an ache at night. But I have learned to calm the beast. Put her to sleep. Let her wait in my dreams. So, when she sleeps, I awake. I sleep so that she can live. And we both live by a truce like this, for ever.\r\u003Cbr \u002F\u003E\r\u003Cbr \u002F\u003E01.08.2021, 02:59 pm, Sun.\r\u003Cbr \u002F\u003E\u003C\u002Fp\u003E",contentClass:"large-5",layout:"flat",meta:{title:b,description:b,keywords:b},og:{type:"article",title:b,description:b,image:f},headImage:{file:f,alt:"sample alt",caption:"Photo by \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Funsplash.com\u002F@invisiblepower?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText\"\u003Einvisiblepower\u003C\u002Fa\u003E on \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Funsplash.com\u002Fs\u002Fphotos\u002Fdivide?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText\"\u003EUnsplash\u003C\u002Fa\u003E\n",cellClass:c},fullSingleHead:b,fullSplitHeadLeft:{gridClass:b,cellClass:c},fullSplitHeadRight:{gridClass:b,cellClass:c,bgImage:b,bgStyle:b},relatedPages:b}}],fetch:[{items:[{title:"A Cat From My Next Door",slug:"a-cat-from-my-next-door",directory:a},{title:"A Few Winters Ago",slug:"a-few-winters-ago",directory:a},{title:"A Hunch And a Dog",slug:"a-hunch-and-a-dog",directory:a},{title:"Beautiful Creatures",slug:"beautiful-creatures",directory:a},{title:"Finding Eternity",slug:"finding-eternity",directory:a},{title:"Ghost",slug:"ghost",directory:a},{title:"Growing Pains",slug:"growing-pains",directory:a},{title:"Hold",slug:"hold",directory:a},{title:"Home",slug:"home",directory:a},{title:"How Do You Live",slug:"how-do-you-live",directory:a},{title:"Humming",slug:"humming",directory:a},{title:"I Am a Poem",slug:"i-am-a-poem",directory:a},{title:"I Cannot Live With You",slug:"i-cannot-live-with-you",directory:a},{title:"I Will Keep a Dog",slug:"i-will-keep-a-dog",directory:a},{title:"If You Can Wait",slug:"if-you-can-wait",directory:a},{title:"In Ruin",slug:"in-ruin",directory:a},{title:"Legacy",slug:"legacy",directory:a},{title:"Maybe I Was a Cat",slug:"maybe-i-was-a-cat",directory:a},{title:"Mollusc",slug:"mollusc",directory:a},{title:"Place",slug:"place",directory:a},{title:"Remember My Name",slug:"remember-my-name",directory:a},{title:"Rose",slug:"rose",directory:a},{title:"Run",slug:"run",directory:a},{title:"Somewhere",slug:"somewhere",directory:a},{title:"The Dust in The House",slug:"the-dust-in-the-house",directory:a},{title:"The Little Mermaid",slug:"the-little-mermaid",directory:a},{title:"Think of Me",slug:"think-of-me",directory:a},{title:d,slug:e,directory:a},{title:"Twenties",slug:"twenties",directory:a},{title:"Unwanted",slug:"unwanted",directory:a},{title:"Waiting",slug:"waiting",directory:a},{title:"When I Am Old",slug:"when-i-am-old",directory:a},{title:"Wander",slug:"wander",directory:a},{title:g,slug:g,directory:a},{title:h,slug:h,directory:a},{title:i,slug:i,directory:a},{title:j,slug:j,directory:a},{title:k,slug:k,directory:a},{title:l,slug:l,directory:a},{title:m,slug:m,directory:a},{title:n,slug:n,directory:a},{title:o,slug:o,directory:a},{title:p,slug:p,directory:a},{title:q,slug:q,directory:a},{title:r,slug:r,directory:a},{title:s,slug:s,directory:a},{title:t,slug:t,directory:a},{title:u,slug:u,directory:a},{title:v,slug:v,directory:a},{title:w,slug:w,directory:a},{title:x,slug:x,directory:a},{title:y,slug:y,directory:a},{title:z,slug:z,directory:a},{title:A,slug:A,directory:a},{title:B,slug:B,directory:a},{title:C,slug:C,directory:a},{title:D,slug:D,directory:a},{title:E,slug:E,directory:a},{title:F,slug:F,directory:a},{title:G,slug:G,directory:a},{title:H,slug:H,directory:a},{title:I,slug:I,directory:a},{title:J,slug:J,directory:a},{title:K,slug:K,directory:a},{title:L,slug:L,directory:a},{title:M,slug:M,directory:a},{title:N,slug:N,directory:a},{title:O,slug:O,directory:a},{title:P,slug:P,directory:a},{title:Q,slug:Q,directory:a},{title:R,slug:R,directory:a},{title:S,slug:S,directory:a},{title:T,slug:T,directory:a}]}],mutations:[["setSponsor",true]]}}("poetic",null,"large-8","Truce","truce","invisiblepower-12VIV1wnG98-unsplash.jpg","一本詩集","不關風月","之前","养猫","半生","几首短诗","发现诗","回云","壁画","夏語","如一首歌","山士","山海記","开花的树","引我向你","旅途","时光","月下读诗","来世","枝椏","櫻花","浪者","浮萍","源頭","灯下","炼","生命的詩集","等你","等待诗人","紅葉","絕筆","藤条","蟑螂","許望","诗的成因","車票","追殺一隻叫做現實的野獸","逃亡","雨城","香茅")));
