It's an arrangement so specialized and particular that it has never\nbeen tried before and will only exist this once.\n\n\u003E Why atoms take this trouble is a bit of a puzzle. Being you is not a\ngratifying experience at the atomic level. For all their devoted attention,\nyour atoms don't actually care about you—indeed, don't even know that you\nare there. They don't even know that they are there. They are mindless\nparticles, after all, and not even themselves alive.\n\n\u003E [...] And when that modest milestone flashes past, or at some\nother point thereabouts, for reasons unknown your atoms will shut you\ndown, silently disassemble, and go off to be other things. And that's it for\nyou.\n\n\u003E Still, you may rejoice that it happens at all. Generally speaking in the\nuniverse it doesn't, so far as we can tell. This is decidedly odd because the\natoms that so liberally and congenially flock together to form living things\non Earth are exactly the same atoms that decline to do it elsewhere.\nWhatever else it may be, at the level of chemistry life is curiously mundane:\ncarbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen, a little calcium, a dash of sulfur, a\nlight dusting of other very ordinary elements—nothing you wouldn't find in\nany ordinary drugstore—and that's all you need. The only thing special\nabout the atoms that make you is that they make you. That is of course the\nmiracle of life.\n\n\u003E So thank goodness for atoms. But the fact that you have atoms and that\nthey assemble in such a willing manner is only part of what got you here.\nTo be here now, alive in the twenty-first century and smart enough to know\nit, you also had to be the beneficiary of an extraordinary string of biological\ngood fortune [...] Life on Earth,\nyou see, is not only brief but dismayingly tenuous. It is a curious feature of\nour existence that we come from a planet that is very good at promoting life\nbut even better at extinguishing it.\n\n\u003E If this book has a lesson, it is that we are awfully lucky to be here—and\nby “we” I mean every living thing. To attain any kind of life in this universe\nof ours appears to be quite an achievement. As humans we are doubly\nlucky, of course: We enjoy not only the privilege of existence but also the\nsingular ability to appreciate it and even, in a multitude of ways, to make it\nbetter. It is a talent we have only barely begun to grasp.\n\n\u003E We have arrived at this position of eminence in a stunningly short time.\nBehaviorally modern human beings—that is, people who can speak and\nmake art and organize complex activities—have existed for only about\n0.0001 percent of Earth's history. But surviving for even that little while has\nrequired a nearly endless string of good fortune.\n\n\u003E We really are at the beginning of it all. The trick, of course, is to make\nsure we never find the end. And that, almost certainly, will require a good\ndeal more than lucky breaks.\n\nBill Bryson, [A Short History of Nearly Everything](https:\u002F\u002Famzn.to\u002F3DpElZq \"A Short History of Nearly Everything: A Journey Through Space and Time\"), 2003. {.line-before}\n",image:a}],fontSizes:a,headImage:a,adImage:{file:"51Jo717gJrL._SX319_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg",title:d,alt:a,caption:"A Short History of Nearly Everything – by Bill Bryson\n",link:"https:\u002F\u002Famzn.to\u002F3DpElZq",cellClass:"medium-6",figcaptionGridClass:"small-padding-collapse",figcaptionCellClass:a},fullSingleHead:{gridClass:"dark-mode image-background",cellClass:"large-6",bgStyle:"'background-position': 'top center'\n",bgImage:f,content:"\u003E For all their devoted attention,\nyour atoms don't actually care about you—indeed, don't even know that you\nare there.
