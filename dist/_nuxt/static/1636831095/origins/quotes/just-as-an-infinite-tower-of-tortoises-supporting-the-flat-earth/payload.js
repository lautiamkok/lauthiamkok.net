Both are theories of the universe, though the\nlatter is much more mathematical and precise than the former. Both theories\nlack observational evidence: no one has ever seen a giant tortoise with the\nearth on its back, but then, no one has seen a superstring either. However,\nthe tortoise theory fails to be a good scientific theory because it predicts that\npeople should be able to fall off the edge of the world. This has not been\nfound to agree with experience, unless that turns out to be the explanation\nfor the people who are supposed to have disappeared in the Bermuda\nTriangle!\n\n\n\u003E [...] if we do discover a complete theory, it should in time be\nunderstandable in broad principle by everyone, not just a few scientists.\nThen we shall all, philosophers, scientists, and just ordinary people, be able\nto take part in the discussion of the question of why it is that we and the\nuniverse exist. If we find the answer to that, it would be the ultimate\ntriumph of human reason—for then we would know the mind of God.\n\n\nStephen Hawking, [A Brief History of Time](https:\u002F\u002Famzn.to\u002F3HtAgGm \"A Brief History of Time: From the Big Bang to Black Holes\"), 1988. {.line-before}\n",image:a}],fontSizes:a,headImage:a,adImage:{file:"51OzG5OkrxL._SX303_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg",title:"A Brief History of Time",alt:a,caption:"A Brief History of Time : From the Big Bang to Black Holes – by Stephen Hawking\n",link:"https:\u002F\u002Famzn.to\u002F3HtAgGm",cellClass:"medium-6",figcaptionGridClass:"small-padding-collapse",figcaptionCellClass:a},fullSingleHead:a,fullSplitHeadLeft:{gridClass:a,cellClass:"large-8",content:"\u003E Just as\nan infinite tower of tortoises supporting the flat earth is such a picture, so is\nthe theory of superstrings.
