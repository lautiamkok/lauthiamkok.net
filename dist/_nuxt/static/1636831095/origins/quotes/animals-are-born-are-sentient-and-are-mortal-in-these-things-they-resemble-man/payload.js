In these things they resemble man. In their superficial anatomy — less in their deep anatomy — in their habits, in their time, in their physical capacities, they differ from man. They are both like and unlike.\n\n\u003E The eyes of an animal when they consider a man are attentive and wary. The same animal may well look at other species in the same way. He does not reserve a special look for man. But by no other species except man will the animal’s look be recognised as familiar. Other animals are held by the look. Man becomes aware of himself returning the look.\n\n\u003E Everywhere animals disappear. In zoos they constitute the living monument to their own disappearance. And in doing so, they provoked their last metaphor.\n\n\u003E All sites of enforced marginalisation — ghettos, shanty towns, prisons, madhouses, concentration camps — have something in common with zoos. But it is both too easy and too evasive to use the zoo as a symbol. The zoo is a demonstration of the relations between man and animals; nothing else.\n\nJohn Berger, [Why Look at Animals?](https:\u002F\u002Famzn.to\u002F2YNIOGA \"Why Look at Animals?\") 2009. {.line-before}\n",image:a}],fontSizes:a,headImage:a,adImage:{file:"book-cover-why-look-at-animals.jpg",title:d,alt:a,caption:e,link:"https:\u002F\u002Famzn.to\u002F2YNIOGA",cellClass:"medium-6",figcaptionGridClass:"small-padding-collapse",figcaptionCellClass:a},fullSingleHead:a,fullSplitHeadLeft:{gridClass:a,cellClass:"large-8",content:"\u003E Animals are born, are sentient and are mortal.
